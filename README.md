# WebDev Project 4 - *Everyday is a Caturday!üòπ *

## Submitted by: **Truc Duong**

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Inspiration 
This week, I will create a web app that allows users to discover more about cats by clicking through random new stuff. 
The web app will display one element at a time with information through API calls to [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) in a random fashion.
The user can influence what they want to see next via a ban list! For example, if the web app showed you a cat that is originated from the England, but you already know a lot about English cats, then you can remove them from future searches

Time spent: **_** hours spent in total

## üéØ Goals
By the end of this assignment I will be able to
- [x] Make a static API call using async/await and save the result to a state variable
- [x] Be able to add and edit query parameters for API calls 
- [x] Parse JSON data from an unfamiliar API

## üëÄ Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

## Video Walkthrough
